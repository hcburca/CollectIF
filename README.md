# CollectIF
A small web app for creating and joining events.

The app is comprised of two parts: 
1.  The user part, where people can create an account, sign-in and demand new events or join existing events.
2.  The admin part, where the administrators set the parameters of the events, as the place and the price.

The app relies on the JavaEE framework for the server-side, and the Bootstrap framework for the client-side.
